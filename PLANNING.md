# Planning

Before propose or writing any application or test code, everything done in this project **MUST** be planned by following an **Intent Driven Development (IDD)** approach, detailed in the @INTENT_SPECIFICATION.md, with an **Incremental Generation Workflow** based on **User Approval** as per detailed instructions on the @DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md.


## 1. On First Use

1.1 When this file is analyzed for the first time by an AI Coding Agent, assistant or LLM, its recommended for it to check the project README for an overview of its features and then check if they are already implemented in the project web and business logic layers. 

1.2 Then ask the user if we wants to proceed with a brainstorm session to discuss and create one Intent per feature not implemented yet, with tasks and sub-tasks. The Intent **MUST** follow the @INTENT_SPECIFICATION.md and the @INTENT_EXAMPLE.md format. 

1.3 If the check of the project code doesn't yield conclusive results about which features are implement and missing then ask the user, instead of making assumptions and guessing. 

 
## 2. User Request

2.1 When a user makes a request, and before proposing any code, the AI Coding Agent, assistant or LLM **MUST** understand the user request and discuss it with the user if it as doubts or needs clarifications.

2.2 Now that the user request is clearly understood it's time to propose an Intent, for user approval as a code change, with a list of Tasks and sub-tasks to complete the user request. The Intent **MUST** follow the @INTENT_SPECIFICATION.md and the @INTENT_EXAMPLE.md format.

2.3 After the Intent is created, as per the Intent specification and example, it's time to ask the user if he wants to continue planning more work on the project or wants to proceed with the implementation of an Intent.
