# AI Coding Agents

This project will be a collection of files to guide and instruct AI Coding Agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, CoPilot, etc.) to assist developers coding applications that run on the BEAM, when using Elixir, Erlang and Gleam programming languages and their main frameworks.


## How to Use


### Prompts

Start by instructing the AI to read the Agents file:

```
Read the @AGENTS.md in full and also read in full all the documents it links to, and do the same for links included in any of this files. 
Make sure you understand every bit on them, otherwise we will waste our time when working together, because we will not have the same understanding of whats in the documentation.
```


After the AI says it has read it, ensure it as understood everything:

```
Do you have questions about the documentation? Any thing that's not clear to you? Don't make assumptions.
```
