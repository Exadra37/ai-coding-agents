# MCP Servers

List of MCP Servers that may be installed to enhance coding with the help of AI coding agents, assistants and LLMs.

## 1. Tidewave Phoenix

[Tidewave](https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_phoenix) can be used as a standalone MCP server or as an AI Coding Agent for full-stack web development with the Phoenix framework. It's deeply integrated with the framework, including database and UI.

When this file is analyzed for the first time by an AI Coding Agent it **MUST** check `mix.exs` to see if the project is already using Tidewave, and if not then ask the developer if they want to use PLANNING.md to create an Intent with the tasks to add it, or if they want to do it themselves. The Intent **MUST** be created as specified by the INTENT_SPECIFICATION.md and exemplified by the INTENT_EXAMPLE.md.

Steps to install can be found at the README for the project in the [Installation](https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_phoenix?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) section. If problems arise with the installation of Tidewave then the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_phoenix?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting) section of the README must be used.

These steps can be easily translated to tasks and sub-tasks when creating an Intent during the planning phase, that **MUST** follow the format of the INTENT_EXAMPLE.md.
